You might say that you don’t have the time to work on gaining peace of mind, but the truth is that you can always find the time, if you really desire it. You might believe that peace of mind can be gained only under special conditions and in special places. That is not true. Circumstances should not bar your way. If your desire for peace of mind is strong enough, you can attain it whether you live in an ashram or in a noisy city.
