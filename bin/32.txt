One way to deal with this is to prepare two lists: one, containing what we consider to be bad habits and two, those which are beneficial to you. 
      It should be remembered that most of our lives are run on habits.  Although, generally not thought of as habits, there are those things which we perform every day or several times a day. Examples are sleeping, washing, etc.  These are necessary and for our purpose, can be considered irrelevant.
