Thoughts too often, come and go and change direction like the wind. They influence your mind the same way that the wind affects the direction of a flag. One moment the flag may be fluttering this way, and a moment later in a different direction. One moment you might be thinking one thing or see things from a certain viewpoint, and a moment later this can change.
