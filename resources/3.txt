Build in your mind a perfect scene of whatever you want to accomplish. Put a lot of detail, color, sound, scents and life into these mental scenes. Repeat them often, with faith and attention, and your subconscious mind will accept them as real experiences, and would therefore, assist you in aligning them with your reality in a most natural way. It will make any necessary changes to make your reality fit your mental images.
