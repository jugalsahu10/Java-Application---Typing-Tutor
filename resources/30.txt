Remember your schooldays when the teacher presented you with an exercise which you would have preferred to avoid 
      However, you had no choice.  So you made the effort and you were pleasantly surprised to find that it wasn't so difficult after all.  Now. of course, there is no teacher standing over you demanding results. Now you have to be your own taskmaster.
