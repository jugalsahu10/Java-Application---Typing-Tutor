A good example of temporary inner peace is a vacation, when you are away from home. After a day or two you begin to experience some kind of inner calmness and tranquility. The mind's feverish tendency to think is quelled down, and the level of worries and endless thinking drops down. In this state of mind, you feel more relaxed and happy, and therefore, you enjoy your vacation.  
By the way, have you noticed that people, who are on vacation, are usually more patient, friendly and well disposed to everyone? This is because their minds are more peaceful.
