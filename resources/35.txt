 Our minds tend to give us what we think.  If you think your road to success is going to be long and hazardous, that's the way it will turn out.  Tell yourself it will be easy and pleasant.  When you have something to do, always tell yourself you will manage it with ease and it will not take long to complete the task.  You will find that this will invariably be the case.
