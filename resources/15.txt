You will probably have no trouble in accepting that it was your good thinking that gave you your success in the past.  However, you will probably blame unfortunate circumstances or other people for your failures.  No matter how it appears, you are solely responsible for the life you have now and your future will be determined by how you think and act now and in the future.
