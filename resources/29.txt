Opportunities 
      Do not sit around waiting for the world to come to you.  It will never happen.  You must constantly be on the lookout for oppor -tunities to improve your life.  You may say that you are never lucky enough to get oppotunities.  Opportunities tend to be rather elusive.  They generally don't tend to jump out in front of you, you have to look for them.  Alternatively, you have to create your own.
