As we go through life, information is passed to the brain via our senses - taste, sight, touch, smell and hearing.  Unfortunatly, much of the information passed is wrong or flawed.  The result is that our conscious and subconscious minds act on the information received and if this is wrong, we suffer the wrong 
circumstances.We cannot filter all information passed to the brain, much of which occurs without our awareness.
