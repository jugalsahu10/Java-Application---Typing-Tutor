The problem for some people is getting started.  They resolve to do something and then decide to start tomorrow or next week.  When tomorrow or next week arrives, they find another excuse for further delay.  The result is that they never make a start at all. Whatever you have decided to achieve, start now,  Once you have started, that will give you the incentive to carry on.
